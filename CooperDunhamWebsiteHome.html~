Over a century later, Cooper & Dunham LLP remains committed to specializing in that practice area.  Cooper & Dunham LLP has been and continues to be composed of leaders in their field of specialization.

The firm's practice groups have assisted clients in the negotiation of complex, corporate acquisitions of technology-oriented businesses, joint research and development agreements and technology licensing agreements in fields ranging from genetic engineering research to software, semiconductors and computer hardware, as well as in the negotiation of brand name, copyright and fictional character licenses, celebrity endorsements and product distribution agreements.
