Attorneys at all levels benefit, from the start of their careers, from direct and meaningful interaction with partners and clients. Our attorneys' workloads are both demanding and diverse. We are involved in numerous, significant matters for high profile clients, and responsibility for complex matters often comes quickly, depending upon individual capability.<br><br>Through a combination of salary, benefits, and bonuses, our compensation package is competitive.

Summer associates are given feedback on their performance through formal reviews at the five-week mark, as well as at the end of the summer. Informal feedback is provided by supervising attorneys as summer associates complete various projects and assignments.<br><br>In addition to a welcome breakfast, farewell reception, and informal lunches with the attorneys, our summer program includes several social events planned to allow summer associates the opportunity to interact with associates and partners outside the office. Past events have included Broadway shows, Yankees and Mets games, museum trips, cultural events, luncheons and cocktail parties.
